I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [Polar Signals](https://www.polarsignals.com/) working on storage systems for continuous profiling data. My work has ranged from implementing distributed CRDTs to diskless architectures. My recent work includes implementing deterministic simulation testing approaches in Go and Rust, enabling us to reproduce and debug complex distributed system failures with precision.

Before Polar Signals, I joined [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) at an early stage. As a software engineer and tech lead on the SQL Execution team, I built and led teams working on the core execution and observability capabilities that databases need to scale.

Alongside my engineering work, I'm a Venture Partner at [Lorimer Ventures](https://www.lorimerventures.com), where I invest in developer tools and data infrastructure. I've been fortunate enough to join successful early-stage startups and watch them scale, which gives me both the technical depth and startup experience to partner with founders building the next generation of developer infrastructure.
