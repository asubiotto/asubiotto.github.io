I am an angel investor and technical advisor. I invest in developer tools,
enterprise tech, and B2B SaaS. I was previously a software engineer and tech
lead at Cockroach Labs working on distributed execution engines and performance.

As an angel investor, I aim to provide as much value as I can. Given my
engineering/technical background, I can help concretely with:
- Designing and performing technical interviews.
- Technical content creation in the form of blog posts or documentation. As a tech lead at Cockroach Labs, [writing blog posts was part of my job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/author/alfonso-subiotto-marques/).
- Software architecture reviews including database performance optimization.
- Growing an engineering organization. I've seen Cockroach Labs grow from 25 to 250 employees.
