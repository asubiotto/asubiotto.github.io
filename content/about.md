I invest in developer/data tools and infrastructure either as an angel or via
[Lorimer Ventures](https://www.lorimerventures.com).
I was previously a software engineer and tech lead at Cockroach Labs
working on distributed execution engines and performance.

As an angel investor, I aim to provide as much value as I can. Given my
engineering/technical background, I can help concretely with:
- Designing and performing technical interviews.
- Technical writing in the form of blog posts or documentation. Here are some links to blog posts I've written at [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/author/alfonso-subiotto-marques/) and [Polar Signals](https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/authors/alfonso-subiotto-marques).
- Software architecture reviews including database performance optimization.
- Growing an engineering organization.
